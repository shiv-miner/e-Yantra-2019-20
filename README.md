Brief Overview of Theme:
                          The theme is about disaster management(flood relief). Theme arena is an abstracted view of the real world which has state, capital, districts, villages, lakes, roads and forests. Robot has to move along the whiteline(highway). Camera which is placed above, emulates satellite in the real world, is used to detect relief aids, track robot using Aruco, instead of extracting features. Overhead camera is used to record video and processed by python script. After video processing, wireless communication(using XBEE modules) is done in order to guide the robot for its movements. After wireless communication everything is handled by a microcontroller(ATmega 328p). White line sensing(using 3-channel white line sensor) is done for following the white line. To dispatch the relief aid, a mechanical structure is used for hitting. In this way a robot with microcontroller, actuators, line sensor, mechanical component and wireless communication module with few other components does it's job. This mimics a real time robot getting signals from satellite and servicing the flood affected cities.Purpose of building this prototype is that we will have the ability to make a complete robot by using technologies like computer vision, machine learning which would be really helpful during disaster times and help people within a short time.
